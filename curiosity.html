                <p>This hand powered mechanism discovered in 1901 and dated back to 100 BC. Presently located in
                    National Archaeological Museum in Athens. Considered to be the first known analog computer.

                <p>Although ''big bang theory' is the prevailing explanation, the quest to know about universe lead to
                    more questions than answers. Well known mysteries: dark energy, anti-matter, existence of parallel
                    universe, direction of time. The more you read about each one the the more dumbfounded you get (at
                    least I do). <br><br>
                    Noteworthy books to get started: 'Astrophysics for People in a Hurry' and 'Cosmic Queries' by Neil
                    deGrasse Tyson; and the classic 'A Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawking.</p>

                <h3 class="subtitle"> The Nature of Time</h3>
                <p>This is one of the greatest mystery of physics. We all age and become decrepit, but there is not
                    return to youth. The fundamental laws in physics does not put any restriction on the direction of
                    time. However, per second law of thermodynamics the disorder always increases with time. This puts
                    the direction on the arrow of time.
                    <br><br>
                    Scientists are debating whether spacetime, like the elementary particles represented in the standard
                    model and the fundamental forces of nature acting on them (gravity, electromagnetism, strong and
                    weak nuclear forces), is a fundamental component of physical reality or is emergent and only has a
                    derivative existence.
                    <br><br>You can scratch you head on this by starting with 'The Order of Time' by Carlo Rovelli ,
                    'Einstein’s
                    Clocks, Poincaré’s Maps: Empires of Time' by Peter Galison, 'From Eternity to Here' by Seal Carroll,

                <h3 class="subtitle"> Can We Know Anything at All (Challenge of Skeptisism)</h3>
                <p>The most obvious starting point of this subject is to address the question in mind: ‘How can I know
                    anything at all?’ To know anything at all is to go through a process of a series of experiences
                    which grow from an opinion, to a belief about it, and finally to justified knowledge. One can have
                    an opinion that a particular event happened, but can’t lay claim to certain knowledge unless this
                    knowledge can be justified. As the event is tested, knowledge about it attains greater certainty.
                    This is true in particular about empirical knowledge, where claims made about certain events can
                    indeed be tested.
                    <br><br>
                    A priori knowledge by its nature is not acquired in the same manner as empirical knowledge. In this
                    case, it is a matter of reasoning through an idea to establish its truthfulness. We observe that the
                    sun is round; but by the very definition of ‘round’ we can come to the conclusion that round objects
                    have no sides: thus, objects that have sides cannot be classified as round.

                <h3 class="subtitle"> The Evolution of Species</h3>
                <p>The original question examined by Charles Darwin—what is the mechanism that causes new species to
                    evolve—has yet to be fully explained. He was haunted by a simple but profound question of how the
                    first flowering plants evolved. One of the biggest mysteries in biology is whether natural selection
                    is the only process that generate new species or are their other material properties that comes into
                    play?<br><br>
                    For example, evolution of eyes, bacterial flagella, wings, and turtle shells. Some of the big ideas
                    toward this are phenotypic plasticity, self-organization, and novelties in nature.<br><br>
                    You can explore this beginning with books such as: 'The Blind Watchmaker' and 'The Greatest Show on
                    Earth' by Richard Dawkins, 'Why Evolution Is True' by Jerry Coyne, 'Charles Darwin: Voyaging' by
                    Janet Brown.
