            This section presents some of the technical/research projects that I worked on and thought would be
            interesting for your perusal. Instead of technical depth, the focus is more on the problem formulation,
            solution
            approach,and generic learning that could be applied somewhere else as well. Interested readers would find
            the
            links helpful for further exploration.

        <h1>Slurry Flows and Cellular Automata</h1>
        <p>As one of the research topics I explored physics-based cellular automata to simulate particle laded flow and
            slurry flows. Although this is still at an academic level, the approach gave me great learnings in numerical
            simulations. Some key learnigs to share are:
            <li>
                Coding CA particle solver in C++. This was a major undertaking and interested readers please take a look
                at the Appendix section of the thesis.
            </li>
            <li>
                I combined the above particle solver with fluid solver in Ansys FLUENTÂ®. This was done through User
                Defined Functions (UDF) and was not trivial.
            </li>
            <li>
                As you delve deeper to capture the physics of particle flows soon you will come across challenges to
                discover new CA rules and philosophical part
            </li>

        <h1>Managing End-of-Life Systems in Semiconductor Manufacturing Using Health Index</h1>
        <p>Equipment at the end of functional life poses several challenges for manufacturing operations and long-term
            asset sustainability. This is even critical for semiconductor manufacturing where equipment upgrades are
            capital intensive with a longer return horizon. This demands an objective and quantifiable approach to
            manage and monitor the end-of-life health of the manufacturing systems.<br>
            <br>This work presents a practical three-level approach that brings together engineering, operational, and
            supply chain factors under a single indicator. A visualization heatmap correlates equipment health to
            manufacturing impact for engineering and commercial decision-making. The approach is simple yet proven to be
            effective in fab environments. The proposed analysis applies in formulating system priorities, upgrade
            strategies, and capital expenditures. Brief guidance on health improvement strategies, application to new
            fab, and cost-based evaluation are presented for practical use.

        <h1>Probabilistic Approach for Equipment Reliability</h1>
        <li>
            Problem: For large and complex systems, such as power plants or heavy machinery, many features, events, and
            processes that control the failure modes are not known with accuracy. Additionally, these systems have
            interdependencies and redundancies. Such complex systems are not mass produces therefore their time history
            is limited for meaningful data analytics. Despite this inherent uncertainty you still need to quantify
            system performance over time. How will you proceed?
        </li>
        <li>
            Solution Approach: In these scenarios, a probabilistic analysis may provide an implementable solution. You
            capture the uncertainties at each component in the form of probability functions. This may need subjective
            assessment. Then propagate this uncertainty through the system model that accounts for interdependencies and
            redundancies.
        </li>

            Learnings: See various case studies done using GoldSim, a Monte-Carlo based simulation software here:
